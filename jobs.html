        <h2 class="animated fadeInLeft">Join Us.</h2>
        <h2 class="animated fadeInRight">For over two decades, we’ve worked with a steady stream of the world’s best brands. We’re a global agency with Canadian roots that have stuck with us: Work hard. Be real. Feel proud, but stay humble. Accept others for who they are. So, while the world knows us as a digital experience design agency with a relentless focus on the customer, we think of ourselves as something more. If that sounds good to you—then we hope you’ll join us.</h2>

        </div>

        <div class="jobsbody-document2-1 animated fadeInLeft">
          <h3>Continued Growth</h3>
          <p>You’ll kick off your first days with Critical Start, an in-depth course on all things CM: our beginnings, culture, disciplines, clients, and work. You’ll also be paired up with a career developer who will help guide your growth. Speaking of growth, we place a huge emphasis on continual learning. To that end, we provide employees with a Professional Development Spending Account that can be used for conferences, courses, subscriptions, books—whatever inspires your curiosity and develops your abilities.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="jobsbody-document2-2 animated fadeInRight">
          <h3>Work Hard, Play Hard</h3>
          <p>Throughout the year we hold several major soirees. Our biggest blow-out is called CMMYs—a celebration of our work, our clients and our people. We also end each week with a little catch-up called beer o’clock where we dabble in different craft beers and catch up with each other. Across our offices, we have no shortage of sports pools, lunch n’ learns, clubs of every kind, and, of course, spectacular parties. Epic, you might say.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="jobsbody-document2-3 animated fadeInUpBig">
          <h3>Reward And Recognize</h3>
          <p>We offer competitive pay and benefits, but we always look for ways to reward those who stand out among their peers and demonstrate true dedication. Each month we give out a handful of spot bonuses, and designate a special “CMVP.” We also appreciate loyalty, and we show it with anniversary awards. Stay for five years and you get five more vacation days and become eligible for a sabbatical. Did we mention that we pay employees for their referrals? So, when you come on board, don’t hesitate to introduce us to other amazingly talented people.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="jobsbody-document2-4 animated fadeInLeft">
          <h3>Helping You Give Back</h3>
          <p>Our mission is to design experiences that improve peoples’ lives. But we don’t stop there. As a successful agency, we believe we have an obligation to give back, help other people, and empower our employees to do the same. Everyone at CM gets eight hours of “giving back” time, and we match charitable donations up to $100USD. Throughout the year, our offices devote time and resources to espousing causes in their community and beyond—sometimes in the form of donated goods and volunteerism, and sometimes through creative work and digital design. We also take on strategic pro bono projects, giving teams the ability to use their skills as a force for good.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="jobsbody-document2-5 animated fadeInUpBig">
          <h3>Liquid Talent</h3>
          <p>Employees and employment are changing, and we’re keeping up by embracing a more globally distributed way of working. Our Liquid Talent initiative gives experienced employees the opportunity to work from wherever is best for them while staying fully engrossed in our culture and the team. As long as you deliver consistent quality work there will be opportunities to work on a variety of clients—no matter which office you’re based in. We also make flexible, reasonable work-from-home arrangements whenever possible.</p>
